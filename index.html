            <p>It is also only the beginning.</p>

            <h4>The future awaits</h4>

            <p>Over the course of this decade, two fundamental trends will cause us to radically rethink the way government works, with major implications for both policy and policymakers alike.</p>

            <p>The first is the acceleration toward ubiquitous availability of general purpose digital technologies. This will make it possible to completely rethink how government organises itself, how it learns and adapts, and how it fosters innovation. At the same time, a population that is always connected and at ease with a digital world will make it possible to entertain radical changes in the way public services are delivered without compromising on quality, engagement or accessibility.</p>

            <p>The second is the shift toward openness as the default, not just in technology but across our economy and society. A genuinely open government that responds to the growing demand from citizens for accountability and participation will deliver better policies and foster stronger communities. And in an open, networked world, we will discover that many of the things that were once the sole preserve of governments are, in fact, sometimes better done by someone else entirely.</p>

            <p>The organisations that are already thriving in this new digital age share some important characteristics. They leverage technology to enable a <em>smaller</em> number of people to get the job done. They set their sights on doing things <em>better</em>, not just by a little but by a very long way. They work <em>faster</em>, iterating rapidly and using data to guide their decisions. And through openness they build <em>stronger</em> communities to support and promote their activities.</p>

            <h4>Recommendations</h4>

            <p>This report looks ahead to the second half of this decade, and considers the big changes that will be needed for government to make the most of the opportunities presented by technology, data and the internet. Our recommendations are organised under three related themes.</p>

            <h5>Root and branch digitisation of government activity</h5>

            <p>By 2020 government must move from <em>digital-by-default</em> to <em>digital, full stop</em>. Moving paper up and down the country is slow and expensive. Government should <strong>eliminate paper</strong> for interactions within and between departments, and <strong>switch exclusively to digital channels</strong> for public services that do not need a face-to-face interaction with the public. Where face-to-face contact is important it should be strengthened.</p>

            <p>There is a huge economic opportunity for the UK if we embrace the concept of government as a platform. Government should adopt <strong>electronic purchasing</strong> to make procurement more efficient and drive take up by businesses. Government should also begin routinely issuing <strong>electronic proofs</strong> instead of paper certificates, and expose <strong>application programming interfaces (APIs)</strong> to enable developers to write apps that can communicate with government systems.</p>

            <h5>Developing a total data approach for government</h5>

            <p>By 2020 government needs to have moved from <em>open data</em> as a fringe activity to <em>total data</em> as its guiding philosophy. Government should extend <strong>lean start-up methods</strong> as a preferred way of working, incorporate <strong>digital and data skills</strong> into the Civil Service competency framework, and establish controls to <strong>ensure policies can be tested against data</strong>. Taken together, these changes should result in better outcomes, delivered more quickly and with less risk.</p>

            <p>A total data approach encompasses a wide variety of data users. Government should <strong>open up all non-personal public sector data</strong> with persistent uniform resource identifiers (URIs), as a foundation for accountability and economic growth. Government should also start <strong>buying in big data analytics</strong> on a payment-by-results basis, to flush out savings that the public sector has thus far been unwilling or unable to realise.</p>

            <h5>Restoring a culture of excellence and innovation in government</h5>

            <p>As is so often the case, the toughest challenges ahead are around <em>people, leadership and organisational change</em>. By 2020 government needs to have developed more outstanding leaders who can drive digital into the DNA of public sector organisations. Government should <strong>increase interchange</strong> so that most senior staff have recent external experience, and <strong>introduce more fixed-term appointments</strong> for senior staff, so that people are crystal clear on their objectives and have a strong incentive to master digital tools and approaches.</p>

            <p>For people working in government, openness, excellence and innovation must be the norm at all levels of responsibility. Government should publish an <strong>open directory of officials</strong> to reduce the friction around open policymaking. Government should also <strong>enrol the top 10% of staff at all grades in an explicit innovation drive</strong>, emulating an approach that has proved successful in many large businesses, and <strong>allow more teams to spin out their activities</strong> in partnership with UK technology start-ups and other partners.</p>

            <h4>Next steps</h4>

            <p>The changes outlined here would mark a wholesale reorientation of the way government is run. They are highly interdependent and so we have not attempted to quantify each in isolation. Nevertheless, our analysis suggests that the potential benefits are significant. If we can accelerate the rate of public sector productivity growth to match that in comparable parts of the private sector, then by 2020 a digitally transformed government could be up to 8% more effective than if it continued doing business as usual. This could free up <strong>Â£24 billion a year</strong> to be spent on a combination of public service expansion and/or deficit reduction.</p>

            <p>There would also be significant benefits beyond the potential to get the same amount done with a smaller number of staff. We would expect a more data-driven approach to drive further reductions in money lost to fraud (including tax fraud), errors and unpaid debt; open and testable policy to result in government making smarter decisions about what works; and open data, APIs, electronic purchasing and electronic proofs to catalyse wider digitisation, promote economic growth, and save time, money and hassle for people on a daily basis.</p>

            <p>This agenda matters for all of us. The notion that we can reach for genuine, transformational change in government, and build a modern, digital, open government to match the needs and expectations of a modern, digital, open society, is one that transcends traditional political ideologies. Starting today, and working together, we can and should remake government for the digital age.</p>


            <h3>Foreword</h3>

            <p>It was Margaret Thatcher who put it best, in her final election rally in 1979: "The heresies of one age give way, as they always do, to the orthodoxies of the next." Amen to that. From the moment I started developing our digital policy agenda seven years ago, I was told that our approach was "unworkable", "risky" and "would push up IT budgets". These predictions were, it turns out, the myopic bleatings of vested interests and ineffectual public sector IT chiefs, but they nevertheless reflected the political establishment's amateurish and corporatist approach to government IT.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, as this wonderful report shows, our "heretical" agenda of open data, open standards and open source software has now become best practice for governments around the world - the new "orthodoxy", so to speak.</p>

            <p>My digital policymaking journey began back in 2006, when I wrote a speech for George Osborne on "Politics and Media in the Internet Age". Looking back on it now, the speech seems quaintly dated in many ways (it's chock-full of MySpace references, for a start), but the core message that the "internet revolution...is bringing about a decisive shift in the balance of power between citizen and state" continues to be at the heart of the Government's vision for technology. In fact, seven years on, this section of the speech is arguably as apposite as ever:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>"But to really harness the new technology, you need to rethink the way public services work. As we move from a one-to-many to a many-to-many world, it won't do to just replicate the same old processes, with new technology."</p>
              
              <p>"After all, it's good that you can now apply for your passport online, but why can't you check hospital waiting lists or doctor appointments in real time? It's a step forward to be able to submit your tax forms online, but why is it not possible to find out where that money is being spent?"</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Of course, before we could get on with harnessing technology to transform public services and the rest, we had to get to grips with the profoundly broken government IT systems we were to inherit from the Labour Government. I'm not making a lame partisan point here, by the way - it's simply a statement of fact. To prove the point, let me give you three statistics that illustrate the catastrophic waste, incompetence and mismanagement that were the hallmarks of the last Government's approach to IT:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>By 2010, Labour was spending Â£25 billion a year on public sector IT - that's more per person than any other country in the world. (To give you a sense of the mind-boggling scale of profligacy and waste, even largely non-transactional departments like BIS were spending more on IT each year than Google...).</li>
            <li>70% of IT spending between 1997 and 2010 went to just seven (!) companies. This was disastrous on two counts: first, it meant that there was next to no competitive tension for public sector IT contracts, so costs were far higher than they would have been; second, it meant that British SMEs were completely locked out of the procurement system, with grotesque negative consequences for costs, innovation and the UK technology economy as a whole.</li>
            <li>In May 2010, we inherited 750 (!) separate government websites, each designed, hosted and created separately, at a staggering cost to taxpayers. Take the Business Link website, for example, which was easily one of the most abysmally designed, confusing and useless websites I've ever seen. The cost? An utterly preposterous Â£105 million for three years. That is at least ten times what that contract ought to have cost - and it's just one of literally hundreds of chronically mismanaged government IT contracts dished out to big business between 1997 and 2010.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So that is what we were up against. In 2007, we set out for the first time our policy framework for getting to grips with this mess, in a speech I wrote entitled (somewhat pretentiously, I'll admit) "Recasting the political settlement for the digital age". Significantly, this speech by George Osborne committed us to opening up government data, creating a level playing field for open source software and introducing open standards for government IT. Taken together, these policies promised to make government more transparent, enable new companies to be built using public sector data, and end the era of massive public sector IT projects and the cosy relationship between the Labour Government and the oligopoly of multinational IT companies that had ripped off taxpayers for well over a decade.</p>

            <p>As you might expect, taking on these vested interests led to an immediate backlash. One global IT company even took to calling Tory MPs and threatening to close down R&amp;D centres in their constituencies, unless we backed down on our commitment to open standards and open source software. To his eternal credit, George Osborne refused to budge an inch.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile we were told by public sector IT "experts" that our spending transparency proposals would cost "hundreds of millions of pounds to implement". To show that this was bunkum, I called Windsor and Maidenhead Council and they immediately agreed to run a spending transparency pilot. Within a few days we were able to declare that their spending data was freely available online, with a total implementation cost of basically zero.</p>

            <p>I flag up these examples to show that almost every inch of the journey towards a modern and transformative agenda for public sector IT was a huge struggle against inertia and bureaucratic opposition, which makes achievements like GOV.UK, the wonderful (and award winning) single portal for government, so spectacular. The fact that the UK is now the world leader in open data, from a standing start in 2010, is also incredible to behold. And of course, the billions of pounds that have already been saved from public sector IT budgets - literally taking Labour contracts that cost billions of pounds, and replacing them with contracts costing a few thousand pounds - are also a proud testament to the fantastic progress that has been made.</p>

            <p>None of this would have been possible if we didn't have political leaders with the appetite to confront the wasteful status quo, when the path of least resistance would have been to carry on as before. George Osborne, who is a true technophile and diehard supporter of innovation and reform, was endlessly curious and supportive from day one. David Cameron and Steve Hilton were immeasurably generous with their time and backing, particularly on open data and opening up government procurement to SMEs. Francis Maude has been a devastatingly powerful leader for this cause in Government, facing down innumerable obstacles thrown up by the bureaucracy and unstinting in his work rate and commitment. Jeremy Hunt has also been a passionate and expert advocate of these policies, as have the tireless Oliver Letwin and the inestimable Ed Davey and Danny Alexander.</p>

            <p>In Opposition, Tom Steinberg (on open data), Mark Thompson (on open source), and Jerry Fishenden and Liam Maxwell (on IT procurement more broadly) were unfailingly generous in donating me their time, ideas and patience as I worked to develop our policy agenda between 2007 and 2010. None of our achievements in this area would have been possible without them, while civil servants such as Jeremy Heywood, Mike Bracken, Tom Loosemore, Andrew Stott, Stephen Kelly and Sally Collier deserve an immense amount of credit for their steadfast commitment to impartial and creative policy implementation.</p>

            <p>Nigel Lawson once told me that you've only really achieved something in Government if you bring about change that the next administration couldn't overturn in a single term. I have no doubt that our achievements on open data, reforming government IT, opening up contracts to SMEs, creating a Government Digital Service and so on fall into this special category. The genie is well and truly out of the bottle, and there's no going back. This Government is widely recognised for driving radical reform in education, welfare reform and deficit reduction. In my view, the IT agenda documented in this report is every bit as important and impressive as those other areas, and I'm sure will come to be seen as such in the days ahead.</p>

            <p>However - the march of technology is relentless, and having fought so hard to overcome the old public sector IT "orthodoxies", we must not ourselves become deaf to the new "heresies" that ought, in time, to supplant our current thinking. That is why Policy Exchange's work in this area is so vitally important - it will help ensure that this Government, and future Governments, are exposed to new provocations and ideas, and continually pushed to make public sector IT even more efficient, even more effective, and even more transformative for citizens. It really is no exaggeration to say that the future of our public services depends on it.</p>
